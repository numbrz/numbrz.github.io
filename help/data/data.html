        <h2>Data in Numbrz</h2>
        <p>Numbrz Models work by reading and writing data from a number of popular services and applications. Your data is made available to a model by creating <em>connections</em>. A connection is a reference to some external data source that you are authorized to access. Once successfully connected, you choose what data (sheets, tables, files, etc.) to make available to the Numbrz application.</p>
