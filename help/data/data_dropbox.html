        <h2>Dropbox Files</h2>
        <p>Numbrz supports CSV (comma separated values) files located on Dropbox. Files must conform to the following:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>The data must standards-compliant CSV.</li>
          <li>For best results, place the files you wish to access in a dedicated folder.</li>
          <li>The first row must be column labels (a header row).</li>
          <li>So we can detect data types, there should be at least one data row.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Connecting to Dropbox</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Type the folder name containing your files at the prompt - don't forget the leading slash ('/').</li>
          <li>Be ready to provide your Dropbox user name and password to authorize Numbrz to access your data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Configuring the Connection</h3>
        <p><b>Overview section</b><br/>This section allows you to set a name and description associated with this data connection. In addition, should your authorization change or expire, you can click the <b>Reconnect</b> button to re-authorize access to your data. In the event of a reconnection, all current configuration, including connected files, is preserved.</p>
        <p><b>Available Tables</b><br/>This section shows the CSV files that are inside the folder you linked, but not yet connected to the Numbrz application. To connect an item, select it from the list and click the <b>Connect Table</b> button. Upon successful connection, it will now appear in the <b>Connected Tables</b> section. Note that information about the available data is stored for short periods of time within Numbrz, if the desired item does not appear in the list, click the <b>Reload</b> button to refresh this information from the folder.</p>
        <p><b>Connected Tables</b><br/>This section shows the data you have connected and made available to the Numbrz application. If there are no items listed here, click the <b>Available Tables</b> section to select data. To manage a connected item, select it from the list. You can perform the following: </p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Edit the <b>Name</b> and <b>Description</b> of the item.</li>
            <li><b>Refresh</b> the columns from the source data. If columns appear in the source data, but are not in the description here, this will update the stored column information from the source.</li>
            <li>Set the data <b>Type</b> of columns. Numbrz does its best to guess the best data type in most cases, but in the event that guess is incorrect, the type can be manually set.
            <li><b>Disconnect</b> the item if it is no longer needed.</li> 
          </ul>
