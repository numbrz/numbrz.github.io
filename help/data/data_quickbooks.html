        <h2>QuickBooks Online</h2>
        <p>Numbrz supports reading data from QuickBooks Online: </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Account List</li>
          <li>General Ledger</li>
          <li>Trial Balance</li>
          <li>Monthly Cash Flow</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All data is <em>read-only</em>. Both explicit date ranges, as well as all QuickBook date macros are supported.</p>
        <h3>Connecting to Quickbooks</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Be ready to provide your QuickBooks user name and password to authorize Numbrz to access your data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Configuring the Connection</h3>
        <p><b>Overview section</b><br/>This section allows you to set a name and description associated with this data connection. In addition, should your authorization change or expire, you can click the <b>Reconnect</b> button to re-authorize access to your data. In the event of a reconnection, all current configuration, including connected data, is preserved.</p>
        <p><b>Available Tables</b><br/>This section shows the QuickBooks data that is available to use. To connect an item, select it from the list, specify a <b>Date Range</b>, then click the <b>Connect Table</b> button. Upon successful connection, it will now appear in the <b>Connected Tables</b> section. Note that information about the available data is stored for short periods of time within Numbrz, if the desired item does not appear in the list, click the <b>Reload</b> button to refresh this information.</p>
        <p><b>Connected Tables</b><br/>This section shows the data you have connected and made available to the Numbrz application. If there are no items listed here, click the <b>Available Tables</b> section to select data. To manage a connected item, select it from the list. You can perform the following: </p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Edit the <b>Name</b> and <b>Description</b> of the item.</li>
            <li><b>Refresh</b> the columns from the source data. If columns appear in the source data, but are not in the description here, this will update the stored column information from the source.</li>
            <li>Set the data <b>Type</b> of columns. Numbrz does its best to guess the best data type in most cases, but in the event that guess is incorrect, the type can be manually set.
            <li><b>Disconnect</b> the item if it is no longer needed.</li> 
          </ul>
