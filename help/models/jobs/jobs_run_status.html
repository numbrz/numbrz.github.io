        <h2>Job Status</h2>
        <p>When a job is run, the Job <b>Status</b> screen is displayed. </p>
        <h3>While a job is running...</h3>
        <p>Running jobs emit information about job progress, including the number of records processed and the time taken to perform operations overall and per Flow Stage.  Use the <i>Cancel Job</i> if you need to cancel a running job. If you navigate away from a job's status, you can always return to it via the <b>Recent Runs</b> section of the <b>Model</b>.</p>
        <h3>When a job ends...</h3>
        <p>Jobs end when they complete successfully, when an error occurs, or when cancelled by a user. The status will show the final result of the job. Two additional buttons are displayed when a job is completed. Use the <i>Next Job</i> button to select and run another job without having to return to the job list. Use the <i>Rerun Job</i> button to run the current job again.</p>
