        <h2>Headcount Tutorial</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          In this tutorial we will build a model which will forecast monthly salary 
          expenses and total headcount. Our model will address a somewhat simplified 
          version of a real-world problem that is often solved using a spreadsheet. We 
          will process an employee table containing start and termination dates and current 
          salaries into a series of monthly totals for planning or forecasting. Consider 
          the spreadsheet below, which endeavors to address this case.
        </p>
        <img
          class="ui image large rounded bordered"
          src="assets/images/example_screenshots/sheet-example.png"
        />
        <p>
          Using a spreadsheet to perform these calculations works, but has several weaknesses 
          that become evident as the amount of data and number of calculations grows.
        </p>
        <h4>New data requires structural changes</h4>
        <p>
          Spreadsheets may often combine data and calculations tightly. In our example, 
          if you want to add more employees or additional forecast dates, you have to insert 
          rows and columns and copy formulas and formats.
        </p>
        <h4>Formulas are difficult to follow</h4>
        <p>
          Even in our simplified example, it is difficult to explain and document the various 
          formulas used. As the complexity of a spreadsheet grows, this worsens to the point 
          that only a handful of persons in the organization may really understand what the 
          formulas do.
        </p>
        <img
          class="ui image large rounded bordered"
          src="assets/images/example_screenshots/sheet-formulas.png"
        />
        <h4>Collaboration is difficult</h4>
        <p>
          The tight coupling of data and calculation, as well as the concentration of understanding 
          in just a few persons make collaboration and division of tasks difficult.
        </p>
        <h4>Processes cannot be automated</h4>
        <p>
          Spreadsheets are not applications, performing any updates always requires manual work.
        </p>
        <h4>The Numbrz Solution</h4>
        <p>
          In the sections that follow, we will build a solution consisting of the following elements:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Simple data tables representing our employee list and the calendar of dates we wish to 
              plan or forecast. This data will not be commingled with calculations and will be easy 
              to change regardless of how complex the overal system becomes. Indeed, persons responsible 
              for maintaining such data can work separately from yet in collaboration with maintainers 
              of other system components.
            </li>
            <li>
              An easy-to-understand function that calculates salary expense and headcount. In Numbrz, 
              functions are clear and self-documenting, unlike formulae in spreadsheets.
            </li>
            <li>
              An automated workflow that uses this function to process our employee and calendar data 
              into a destination spreadsheet that can be used for visualization and further analysis. 
              Workflows turn data and functions into full-blown applications.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Setting Up Functions</h3>

        </p>

        <h3 id="datasets-header">Setting Up Datasets</h3>
        <p>
          In order for our headcount workflow to work with real data we have to
          configure three datasets: Input, Calendar, and Output. Create a GSheet
          with three tabs titled: Employee Payroll, Calendar, and Monthly
          Payroll. The Employee Payroll tab should match the following structure
          and content:
        </p>
        <img
          class="ui image large rounded bordered"
          src="assets/images/example_screenshots/EmployeePayroll-GSheet.png"
        />
        <p>
          The Calendar tab should match the following structure and content:
        </p>
        <img
          class="ui image large rounded bordered"
          src="assets/images/example_screenshots/Calendar-GSheet.png"
        />
        <p>
          The Monthly Payroll tab should match the following structure and
          content:
        </p>
        <img
          class="ui image big rounded bordered"
          src="assets/images/example_screenshots/Output-GSheet.png"
        />

        <h4 id="connect-gsheets">Connecting GSheets to Numbrz</h4>
        <p>
          Before we can use the GSheets we created in our workflow, we need to
          connect them to Numbrz. Connecting external data sources is easy,
          simply click the 'plus' icon on the bottom right corner of the Data
          tab screen and fill out the necessary information. In our case, we
          want to connect a GSheet, which is the default external data source.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each GSheet tab in our document: copy the url from the browser and
          paste it into the form, title each dataset accordingly, and click
          'Connect'.
        </p>
        <img
          class="ui image bordered rounded big"
          src="assets/images/example_screenshots/gsheet-url.png"
        />
        <p>
          We will also need to share our GSheet with Numbrz. To do so, copy the
          Numbrz agent information from the dialog.
        </p>
        <img
          class="ui image bordered rounded large"
          src="assets/images/example_screenshots/numbrz-share.png"
        />
        <p>
          In Gsheets, click 'Share' in the top right corner and paste the copied
          address into the form.
        </p>
        <div
          class="ui images bordered rounded medium
        "
        >
          <img
            class="ui image "
            src="assets/images/example_screenshots/gsheet-share.png"
          />
          <img
            class="ui image "
            src="assets/images/example_screenshots/gsheet-share-2.png"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          The final list of datasets in Numbrz should look similar to the one
          below:
        </p>
        <img
          class="ui image big bordered rounded"
          src="assets/images/example_screenshots/datasets-final.png"
        />

        <h3 id="workflow-header">Setting Up A Workflow</h3>
        <h4 id="workflow-overview">Overview</h4>
        <p>
          The purpose of this workflow is to combine the execution of the
          previously constructed Headcount function and some basic aggregation
          to produce summary output that can be used for planning and
          forecasting. The workflow will:
        </p>
        <div class="ui ordered list">
          <div class="item">
            Iterate over the Employee Payroll data and apply our Calendar, which
            is the series of dates we want to forecast or plan.
          </div>
          <div class="item">
            For each combination of employee record and calendar month, execute
            our function.
          </div>
          <div class="item">Total the function output by month.</div>
          <div class="item">
            Write the totals to the Monthly Payroll dataset previously defined.
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Begin a new workflow by selecting the Workflows tab and clicking the
          '+' in the lower right corner. You should see a dialog similar to the
          following:
        </p>
        <img
          class="ui image large bordered rounded"
          src="assets/images/example_screenshots/add-workflow.png"
        />
        <p>
          Give your workflow meaningful name like Tutorial - Headcount and
          optionally a Scenario name, which is just an extra user-definable
          category you may apply to your workflows. Finally, in the Source Data
          drop down, select the Employee Payroll dataset previously configured
          and click Create. You will now see the Workflow Builder.
        </p>
        <img
          class="ui image big bordered rounded"
          src="assets/images/example_screenshots/workflow-builder.png"
        />
        <p>
          Note the warning letting you know that no steps have been configured.
          We will now add steps to make this workflow functional.
        </p>
        <h4 id="workflow-fill-step">Fill Data Step</h4>
        <p>
          The first step to add will be a Fill step. Fill produces a union of
          input data and some other dataset. It will produce up to 300 fill
          records for each input record. A common use of Fill is to join data
          with a calendar of dates, which is what we will do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drag the Fill step from the palette to the right and drop it below the
          Workflow Settings. Note that you can edit the default title 'Fill Data
          Step' to make it more meaningful try changing the title to Apply
          Calendar. Now select the Calendar dataset you previously created from
          the drop down and, in the fill fields section, select the Month field.
          Your workflow should now look like this.
        </p>
        <img
          class="ui image big bordered rounded"
          src="assets/images/example_screenshots/fill-step.png"
        />
        <p>
          Note the icon to the right of the step title. This is a
          expand/collapse button. It can be helpful to collapse the
          configurations as you complete each step, making more room on screen
          to view the workflow without scrolling.
        </p>
        <h4 id="workflow-exec-step">Execute Function Step</h4>
        <p>
          Now we have employee payroll data and our period month ends flowing
          through the workflow. We will use our Payroll function to actually
          calculate the employees total salary per period.
        </p>
        <p>
          To execute a function, drag an Execute step from the palette and drop
          it below the Fill step. Give the step a name like Calculate Monthly
          Payroll and , from the drop-down, select the function you built
          previously. Under inputs, map workflow data elements to the
          appropriate function input. Note that the available data fields have
          been categorized by source.
        </p>
        <p>
          Workflow Data to Function Input:
        </p>
        <div class="ui bulleted list">
          <div class="item">
            Employee Payroll -> AnnualSalary to Annual Salary
          </div>
          <div class="item">Employee Payroll -> StartDate to Start Date</div>
          <div class="item">Employee Payroll -> EndDate to Term Date</div>
          <div class="item">Calendar -> Month to Current Month</div>
        </div>
        <p>Your workflow will now look like this:</p>
        <img
          class="ui image big bordered rounded"
          src="assets/images/example_screenshots/exec-step.png"
        />

        <h4 id="workflow-aggr-step">Aggregate Step</h4>
        <p>
          Our goal is to produce a forecast by month of payroll costs from our
          employee data and calendar. To do this, we need to aggregate the
          payroll data by month. Drag an Aggregate step from the palette, and
          drop it below the Execute step. Give it a title like Sum Salaries by
          Period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under Aggregate, select Sum for Calculation and Monthly
          Payroll->MonthlySalary for Field. Click '+' to add this calculation.
          Add another calculation, Sum on Monthly Payroll->Monthly Headcount,
          click '+' to add this calculation. Under Group By, select Tutorial
          Calendar->Month Click '+' to add this group.
        </p>
        <p>Your workflow will now look like this:</p>
        <img
          class="ui image big bordered rounded"
          src="assets/images/example_screenshots/aggr-step.png"
        />

        <h4 id="workflow-output-step">Output Step</h4>
        <p>
          This will be the final step in this workflow. It will store results in
          the Monthly Payroll dataset (A linked Google Sheet) that was created
          previously. In addition to input data and the results of step
          processing, several built-in data fields are available. We will use
          several of these to uniquely identify each execution of our workflow,
          so that the output data can be used to compare different scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start by dragging the Output step from the palette and dropping it
          below the Aggregate step created above. Give it a title like Output
          Monthly Salaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under outputs, map workflow data elements to the appropriate dataset
          field. Note that the available data fields have been categorized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Workflow Data to Output Dataset:
        </p>
        <div class="ui bulleted list">
          <div class="item">Builtins -> Run ID to Run ID</div>
          <div class="item">Builtins -> Run By to Run By</div>
          <div class="item">Builtins -> Time Started to Run At</div>
          <div class="item">Calendar -> Month to Month</div>
          <div class="item">Aggregate -> Sum of Monthly Salary to Salary</div>
          <div class="item">
            Aggregate -> Sum of Monthly Headcount to Headcount
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Your workflow should now look like this:</p>
        <img
          class="ui image big bordered rounded"
          src="assets/images/example_screenshots/output-step.png"
        />

        <h4 id="workflow-status">Running Headcount Workflow</h4>
        <p>
          Once all steps have been added, and no configuration warnings are
          displayed, the workflow is ready to run.
        </p>
        <p>
          Click Run Workflow in the lower right corner to execute the workflow.
          You will see a status page. Note that workflows run in the background,
          so there is no need to wait on the status page, however in this case,
          the workflow should complete in just a few seconds, so we'll watch
          what happens. If all goes as it should, you will see the following
          after a few seconds:
        </p>
        <img
          class="ui image big bordered rounded"
          src="assets/images/example_screenshots/run-status.png"
        />
        <p>
          The counts displayed on the final status may be different for you,
          depending on how much sample data you added to your Google Sheets.
          Have a look at your Monthly Payroll sheet. You should see one row of
          data for each month in your calendar.
